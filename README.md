# Life's Precious Moments


# What was My motivation?

Becouse I watched my wife delete pictuers of my kids 

# What problem does it solve?

You dont't have to delete pic's just becouse you dont have space for them and you can share them with family or frends over a safe network 

# What did you learn?

Everything
